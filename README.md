# ratpoints

## The ratpoints library and command-line program

This is a program that uses an optimized quadratic sieve algorithm in order
to find rational points on hyperelliptic curves.

The program is distributed under the GNU GPL, version 2 (or later).

Read the [documentation](https://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/stoll/programs/ratpoints-doc-2.2.pdf).

The current version is ratpoints-2.2.1 from January 18, 2022. This version can use 256-bit AVX
registers and has been optimized further, so that it now runs considerably faster than ratpoints-2.1.3.
